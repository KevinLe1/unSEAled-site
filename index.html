<div class="next-event-container">
	<p>The purpose of unSEAled is to provide a space to share Southeast Asian and Southeast Asian American experiences through writing, art, music, film, and photography. This project is being created in collaboration between numerous organizations on campus, including but not limited to the Vietnamese Students Association, Liga Filipina, the Singapore Students Asscociation, Thai Club, and the Queer & Asian Club.
    <br><br>
  The unSEAled zine will consist of both student submissions and curated selections of prominent Southeast Asian and Southeast Asian American artists. There will both a print and online version. There is no requirement on what type of works are submitted, as long as you are Southeast Asian or Southeast Asian American. We ultimately hope to elevate Southeast Asian and Southeast Asian American voices while bringing together and showcasing our diverse communities.
  <br><br>
      <p>During the month of October and November, we'll gradually share various student submissions (as permitted by the artist), curated selections, interviews, and blog posts on this website. Stay tuned for more and follow us on Facebook!</p>

  <h2><strong>Any work of art, writing, music, film, or photography can be submitted to the unSEAled Zine!</strong></h2>

  <p>There will be two different versions of the unSEAled zine: a print version and an online version. The print version will be limited to art, writing, and photography. The online version will also feature music and film. During the months of October and November, we will gradually add previews and submissions to this website leading up to the launch. As the artist, you can tell us whether or not you want this to occur with your piece in your submission form!</p>

        </strong></h2>
        <p>In <a href="https://medium.com/@unsealed.zine/the-mutilation-of-our-mother-tongue-670079b977ee">Part 1</a> of his submission, Tyler shared an original poem written in response to a new educational curriculum in Vietnam that risks seriously altering the Vietnamese language for future generations. This is the accompanying article written by Tyler, detailing the way this new system works to change the way Vietnamese children read, write and visualize their mother tongue.

    <h2>The Mutilation of Our Mother Tongue (Pt 1.): an interview with Tyler Nguyen
        <br><strong>Conducted by Jade Onn
        </strong></h2>
        <p>Tyler Nguyen is a Freshman at Columbia College, majoring in Financial Economics. He is from Michigan U.S. but spent 11 years in Ho Chi Minh City. The following poem and its translation was written in response to alterations in the Vietnamese language, caused by a new education curriculum being tested in Vietnam. Tyler also explains the significance of this traditional Lục Bát form and why he chose it.
        <br><br>Part 2 of this submission, an accompanying essay which delves into the system that is currently altering the pedagogy of the Vietnamese language, will be published next week.</p>

She is interested in linguistics and is an avid painter. Here, Celia discusses several of her paintings and how making art functions as a method of expressing her identity as a queer and Asian woman.
